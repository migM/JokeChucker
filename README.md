# The Joke Chucker is your Chuck Norris joke generator. 

## It chucks jokes! To run this application and have access to all the code that makes it work, we need a few things off the bat:
- GIT - Download here: ('https://git-scm.com/downloads'))
> so you have access to all of GIT's functionalities and are able to clone the project directly to our machine

- Node.Js - Download here: ('https://nodejs.org/en/download'))
> so you can get the packages, build, test and development server tools

- Visual Studio Code - Download here: ('https://code.visualstudio.com/download') 
> so you can mess around with the code

## Once you have these, open a command line in the desired path on your machine and copy the following command to your command line:
 `git clone https://github.com/migM/JokeChucker`

## > Inside your brand spanking new JokeChucker directory, make sure to navigate to /src/ ...
`cd .\JokeChucker\src\`

## > ... and run the command 
`npm install` to get all the dependencies for the project to run as it should.

## > After getting those sweet, sweet packages installed simply run the command ...
`ng serve`

## ... and open your browser on:
`http://localhost:4200`

## After that, interact with the page and it should be self-explanatory from there!

# Further reading

## This project was developed in a short time as an answer to a code challenge. Therefore, there are many features I would like to have made but unfortunately didn't have much more time to develop. Some of these include:

 > Better test coverage; given that most of the logic on this project is based on the viewer component, the most coverage lies in that specific component. However, in an ideal situation, the project would have around the same coverage across all components.

 > A more profoundly developed theming structure around the styles; the styles attributed to the app were all shared to keep a stronger theme, but a lot of specification wasn't made around this topic beforehand: a general design goal to make it more concise aside from a single page application with the same colors repeating across buttons would assure a better looking UI and better readability.

 > More categories and share functionalities similar to the ones in place; such as for example share to Facebook and all the Meta platforms, a print functionality and overall more options to choose from the dropdown since the API provides several categories that were not included for the sake of simplifying the project given the time restraints.

> A favourites page where we could save our favorite jokes in a list.

> Make a chucker-service that makes the API calls so these calls can be used across the entire application when it's more feature-full; that way the individual components don't have to house all the logic and the usage of the calls to the API can be done across the entire app

> Better image assets! Specifically, Chuck images that hadn't been generated by an AI tool online and subsequently worked on in Photoshop in a short time would make the dynamic appearance of our "mascot" (sorry Chuck) in the front page much more professional.
