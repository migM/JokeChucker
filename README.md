# Further reading

## This project was developed in a short time as an answer to a code challenge. Therefore, there are many features I would like to have made but unfortunately didn't have much more time to develop. Some of these include:

 > better test coverage; given that most of the logic on this project is based on the viewer component, the most coverage lies in that specific component. However, in an ideal situation, the project would have around the same coverage across all components.

 > a more profoundly developed theming structure around the styles; the styles attributed to the app were all around shared to keep a stronger theme, but a lot of specification wasn't made around this topic: a general design approach aside from a single page application with the same colors repeating across buttons would assure a better looking UI and better readability

 > better image assets! specifically, Chuck images that hadn't been generated by an AI tool online and subsequently worked on in Photoshop in a short time would make the dynamic appearance of our "mascot" (sorry Chuck) in the front page much more professional

 > more categories and share functionalities similar to the ones in place; such as for example share to Facebook and all the Meta platforms, a print functionality and overall more options to choose from the dropdown since the API provides several categories that were not included for the sake of simplifying the project given the time restraints.
